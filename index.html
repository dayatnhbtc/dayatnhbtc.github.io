            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Welcome!
My name is Hidayat. I’m an e-commerce and procurement professional, currently working at PT. Volar Mekanikal Teknologi.</p>
            <p>Outside of work, I’m passionate about technology, coding, and building tools that simplify real-world operations.</p>
            <p>I’m learning React, Next.js, and systems integration with tools like Supabase, Coda.io, and n8n. My interests also include workflow automation, data handling, and building resilient personal systems.</p>
            <p>I’m grounded in Stoic philosophy, and I believe in continuous self-improvement through learning, thinking, and building.</p>
            <p>Feel free to check out my past projects or some experiments I’ve done.</p>
            <p>Learn. Build. Iterate.</p>
